###SUICIDE 1.0.0

#####credits: original concept/code by Grafzahl/overhaul by mudzereli


Out of the box, it adds a right click action to most pistols in the game that allows you to commit suicide.

It's configurable, cancellable, triggered outside of the scroll menu, and it plays randomly one of 2 animations :)

For some samples of what it can do, check out this gallery on imgur:
